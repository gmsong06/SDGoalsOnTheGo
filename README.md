# SDGoals On The Go
An IOS app that allows users to make contributions the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

## Overview
SDGoals On The Go refers to the United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals. These goals often come accross as "lofty" or even difficult. This was also my first reaction and I wanted to be able to make something that would empower normal people to be able to make a difference. This IOS app will allow users to get a brief introduction on each of the Sustainable Development Goals and also have the ability to add, remove, and claim tasks (i.e. Donate to charity). There are tasks that have preset points in which claiming the task will allow you to claim the points that the task is worth. If you don't like any of the preset tasks you can also create your own task and set your own point value.
<br />
The app also includes a badge system which includes (so far) 7 badges:
<br />
- 50 Points
- 100 Points
- 200 Points
- 500 Points
- 50 Tasks
- 100 Tasks
- 200 Tasks
<br />
You are able to acquire these badges through claiming tasks along with its points. Your overall point, task, and badge count is available on your profile page.
<br />
Here is a brief summary of all the pages:

**Home**
<br />
This page lets you read and learn about all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In each Goal there is an introduction and some statistics. This is meant to be a brief overview of the topic. Each Goal page also includes a list of 5 tasks that you can add to your Task List that relate to this certain Goal along with links that lead to further information.

**TaskList**
<br />
This page holds all of the tasks that you have yet to complete that you have added through either a Goal Page (info on that above) or a task that you created yourself. This page has the ability to add a task, delete a task and claim the task resulting in some amount of points being added to that user's overall point and task count.

**Profile**
<br />
A simple profile view of the user's username, points, tasks completed and badges earner.

**Badges**
<br />
This is where the user can view their badges.

**Leaderboard**
<br />
A page where you can see your ranking compared to other users registered on the app (work in progress)
